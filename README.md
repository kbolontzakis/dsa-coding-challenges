# DSA-Coding-Challenges

Welcome to the **DSA-Coding-Challenges** repository! This repository contains a collection of coding challenges and solutions focused on **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** (DSA). The goal is to help improve problem-solving skills, prepare for technical interviews, and gain a deeper understanding of DSA concepts.

## Repository Structure

- **Coding Challenges**: A collection of various programming challenges that focus on different aspects of algorithms and data structures.
- **Data Structures**: Implementations and explanations of fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.
- **Algorithms**: Solutions and explanations for common algorithmic problems such as sorting, searching, dynamic programming, recursion, greedy algorithms, and more.

## Topics Covered

- **Arrays & Strings**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks & Queues**
- **Trees & Graphs**
- **Sorting & Searching Algorithms**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Recursion**
- **Bit Manipulation**

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kbolontzakis/DSA-Coding-Challenges.git
   ```

2. Explore the coding challenges in the `src/Challenges/` directory and the data structures and algorithms implementations in the `src/Dsa/` directory.

3. You can add your own solutions or attempt the existing challenges. Feel free to contribute!
